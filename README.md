I love this guy and I love Django.  I highly recommend this YouTube channel to all beginner Python developers.<br>Learning basics - setting up a simple Django application, creating a database, allowing users to sign up, sign in, and sign out, showing user-specific pages, HTML custom forms, admin dashboard, sidebar, and adding bootstrap.
